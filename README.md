# Fraud Detection

This is a Data Science Project featuring Data Analysis to find out what factors indicate that a transaction might be fraud.
Then Deploying Machine Learning Algorithms such as Logistic regression, Random Forest and k-nearest neighbors to predict whether a transaction is fraud or not

In the 'Fraud Detection Web App' folder, I created a web app with Flask that uses the k-nearest neighbors model to predict fraud transactions
